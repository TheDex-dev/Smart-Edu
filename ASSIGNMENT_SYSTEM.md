# Teacher and Student Assignment System

## Overview

I've successfully created separate screens for teachers and students to handle assignments in your Smart Edu app. The system now supports role-based assignment management with full teacher-to-student assignment distribution capabilities.

## New Features Added

### 1. Role-Based Assignment System
- **Automatic Role Detection**: The app now automatically detects whether a user is a teacher or student
- **Role Selection**: If no role is set, users can choose their role (Teacher/Student)
- **Dynamic Screen Routing**: Users see different interfaces based on their role

### 2. Teacher Assignment Screen (`teacher_assignment_screen.dart`)
**Features for Teachers:**
- ✅ Create new assignments with detailed information
- ✅ View all assignments they've created
- ✅ Edit existing assignments
- ✅ Distribute assignments to specific students
- ✅ Delete assignments
- ✅ Search and filter assignments by subject
- ✅ Assignment statistics dashboard
- ✅ Student management (view available students)

**Assignment Creation Includes:**
- Title, Subject, Description
- Due date selection
- Points/marks allocation
- Class/grade assignment
- Student selection (multi-select)
- Assignment status tracking

### 3. Student Assignment Screen (`student_assignment_screen.dart`)
**Features for Students:**
- ✅ View all assignments assigned to them
- ✅ Filter assignments by status (All, Pending, Completed, Overdue)
- ✅ Search assignments by title, subject, or teacher
- ✅ Mark assignments as completed
- ✅ View detailed assignment information
- ✅ Assignment statistics (total, pending, completed, overdue)
- ✅ Visual status indicators (overdue, due soon, completed)

**Assignment Details Include:**
- Teacher name and subject
- Due date with status indicators
- Points allocation
- Assignment description
- Completion status

### 4. Enhanced Assignment Model
The Assignment model has been expanded to support:
- `teacherId` - ID of the teacher who created the assignment
- `teacherName` - Display name of the teacher
- `assignedTo` - List of student IDs assigned to the assignment
- `className` - Class or grade level
- `points` - Points or marks for the assignment

### 5. Firebase Service Integration
Added new methods to handle the teacher-student assignment system:
- `getTeacherAssignments()` - Fetch assignments created by the current teacher
- `getStudentAssignments()` - Fetch assignments assigned to the current student
- `getStudents()` - Get list of all students for assignment distribution
- `getCurrentUserProfile()` - Get current user's profile including role
- `updateUserProfile()` - Update user profile information

## How It Works

### For Teachers:
1. **Dashboard**: See assignment statistics and overview
2. **Create Assignment**: Use the floating action button to create new assignments
3. **Manage Students**: Select which students to assign work to
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor assignment completion and due dates
5. **Edit/Delete**: Manage existing assignments with full CRUD operations

### For Students:
1. **Assignment Feed**: View all assignments in a clean, organized list
2. **Status Tracking**: Visual indicators show assignment status (pending, overdue, completed)
3. **Quick Actions**: Mark assignments as completed with one tap
4. **Detailed View**: Tap any assignment to see full details
5. **Search & Filter**: Find specific assignments quickly

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
lib/
├── screens/
│   ├── teacher/
│   │   └── teacher_assignment_screen.dart     # Teacher dashboard
│   ├── students/
│   │   └── student_assignment_screen.dart     # Student assignment view
│   └── role_based_assignment_screen.dart      # Role detection & routing
├── models/
│   ├── assignment.dart                        # Enhanced assignment model
│   └── user_profile.dart                      # User profile with roles
└── services/
    └── firebase_service.dart                  # Backend integration
```

### Database Schema
The system uses Firestore collections:
- `assignments` - Assignment documents with teacher and student references
- `users` - User profiles with role information

### Navigation Integration
The main app navigation has been updated to use the new `RoleBasedAssignmentScreen`, which automatically routes users to the appropriate interface based on their role.

## Testing & Mock Data
Added comprehensive mock data for testing:
- Sample teacher assignments with student assignments
- Mock student data for assignment distribution
- Realistic assignment scenarios with various due dates and subjects

## Key Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Teachers and students have distinct, focused interfaces
2. **Role-Based Security**: Users only see features appropriate to their role
3. **Real-time Updates**: Changes sync across all users instantly
4. **Offline Capability**: Robust caching and error handling
5. **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive design with smooth animations
6. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend with additional features

## Future Enhancements
The foundation is now in place for additional features like:
- Assignment submission system
- Grading and feedback
- Notification system
- File attachments
- Assignment templates
- Class management
- Parent/guardian access

The system is fully integrated and ready to use! Teachers can start creating and distributing assignments, while students can view and manage their assigned work.
